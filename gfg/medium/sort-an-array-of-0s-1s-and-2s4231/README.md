## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s **.**  Sort the array in ascending order. 

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Explanation: 0s, 1s and 2s are segregated into ascending order.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public void sort012(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.length - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                int temp = arr[low];
                arr[low] = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = temp;
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                int temp = arr[mid];
                arr[mid] = arr[high];
                arr[high] = temp;
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
}
