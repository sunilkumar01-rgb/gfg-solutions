![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array  **arr[]**  and a positive integer  **k**, find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of the elements divisible by k.

 **Note:** If there is no subarray with sum divisible by k, then return 0.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarray [7, 6, 1, 4] has sum = 18, which is divisible by 3.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [-2, 2, -5, 12, -11, -1, 7], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The subarray [2, -5, 12, -11, -1] has sum = -3, which is divisible by 3.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, -2], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray is [2, -2] has sum = 0, which is divisible by 2.
```

    public int longestSubarrayDivK(int[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put(0, -1); 

        int maxLen = 0;
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
            int rem = (int)(sum % k);

            if (rem < 0) {
                rem += k;
            }

            if (map.containsKey(rem)) {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - map.get(rem));
            } else {
                map.put(rem, i);
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```
