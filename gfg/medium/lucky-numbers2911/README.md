# Lucky Numbers

## Problem

Given an integer  **n**, determine if it is a  **Lucky Number**.

Lucky numbers are identified using a elimination process on the infinite sequence of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4,...):
    **1.** Remove every 2nd number from the sequence.
    **2.** From the remaining sequence, remove every 3rd number.
    **3.** From the remaining sequence, remove every 4th number, and so on...

This continues indefinitely. Return  **true**  if  **n**  survives the elimination process (is a lucky number). Otherwise, return  **false**.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: false
Explanation: 5 is not a lucky number as it gets deleted in the second iteration.

```

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation: 19 is a lucky number because it does not get deleted throughout the process.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤  n ≤  108

```java
class Solution {
    public static boolean isLucky(int n) {
        return isLuckyHelper(n, 2);
    }

    private static boolean isLuckyHelper(int n, int counter) {
        if (counter > n) return true;
        if (n % counter == 0) return false;

        // After removing elements, the position shifts
        return isLuckyHelper(n - (n / counter), counter + 1);
    }
}
```
