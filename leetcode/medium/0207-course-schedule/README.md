# Course Schedule

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you  **must**  take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        
        int[] indegree = new int[numCourses];
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            graph.get(pre[1]).add(pre[0]);
            indegree[pre[0]]++;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) queue.add(i);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int course = queue.poll();
            count++;
            for (int next : graph.get(course)) {
                indegree[next]--;
                if (indegree[next] == 0) queue.add(next);
            }
        }
        
        return count == numCourses;
    }
}
```
