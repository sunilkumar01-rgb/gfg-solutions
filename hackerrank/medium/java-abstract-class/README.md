# Java Exception Handling

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

A Java abstract class is a class that can't be instantiated. That means you cannot create new instances of an abstract class. It works as a base for subclasses. You should learn about Java Inheritance before attempting this challenge. 

Following is an example of abstract class:

```java
abstract class Book{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}
```

If you try to create an instance of this class like the following line you will get an error:

```java
Book new_novel=new Book(); 
```
    
You have to create another class that extends the abstract class. Then you can create an instance of the new class. 

Notice that *setTitle* method is abstract too and has no body. That means you must implement the body of that method in the child class.

In the editor, we have provided the abstract *Book* class and a *Main* class. In the Main class, we created an instance of a class called *MyBook*. Your task is to write just the *MyBook* class. 

Your class mustn't be public.

**Sample Input**

    A tale of two cities

**Sample Output**

    The title is: A tale of two cities


**Input Format**

 

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

```java

class MyCalculator {
    /*
    * Create the method long power(int, int) here.
    */
        long power(int n, int p) throws Exception {
        if (n < 0 || p < 0) {
            throw new Exception("n or p should not be negative.");
        }
        if (n == 0 && p == 0) {
            throw new Exception("n and p should not be zero.");
        }
        return (long) Math.pow(n, p);
    }
}


```
